# hello-world
my first repository
Hi! My name is Mike and I'm a beginning web developer. I started my coding journey in high school with courses in visual basic, c++, java, html, sql, and css. I've taken intro coding courses at Missouri State University and Truman State University and hope to advance my knowledge online before returning to a program to finish my degree for Web Development.
